## What regression analysis is about
What about if we want to predict the value of one variable based on the knowledge about another variable.

### Type of variables

- Ordinal: school grades, Michelin stars
- Categorical: country of birth, gender, etc

### Dependent or outcome variables
It is assumed to be predictable from some other variables
### Independent or predictor variables
Use them to explain the variance in the dependent variables
